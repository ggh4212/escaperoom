            <h1>Pros and Cons of Cloud Computing</h1>
            <p>Cloud computing is the practice of using a network of remote servers hosted 
            on the Internet to store, manage, and process data, rather than a local server
            or a personal computer.</p>

                        On public cloud services like YouTube, lots of people 
                        can view it without having to install it first.
                    </td>
                    <td>If you're data is in the cloud, some companies 
                        make it harder for you to leave and/or migrate to a different company.

                        Things in the cloud don't take up space on various devices.
                        For example, a phone, PlayStation, XBox, and a computer don't lose
                        a bunch of memory to utilize cloud computing.
                    </td>
                    <td>Sometimes, for extra cloud storage and data, you must up the cost
                        and it isn't cheap like a dollar extra.

                        Cloud computing is done through hundreds or even thousands of computers
                        (or server farms.) Your data is always safe because if one server holding
                        your data breaks, then someone will switch your data to a different server 
                        and you wouldn't even notice!
                    </td>
                    <td>So how safe can your cloud data actually be? cloud computing is internet computing
                        so you need to make sure some downloadable items are real and not just fake examples of cloud computing.
